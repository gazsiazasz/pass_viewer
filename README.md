# Linksys SimpleTap Password Decrypter

1. You have to pass the NDEF string from the card that you got with the router as the argument. (*linksyssmartwifi://...*)
2. The program outputs the decrypted SSID and the password for the Linksys SimpleTap Wi-Fi.
3. You can write it back to the router's NVRAM into the *tc_ssid* and the *tc_passphrase* variables.
